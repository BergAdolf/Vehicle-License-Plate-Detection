# Vehicle-License-Plate-Detection
This is an end to end license plate detection program. First, this program
implements the license plate detection method based on Yolov3 and the license 
plate location method based on WPOD-NET network. Next, in order to carry out 
license plate detection and license plate location, it use SORT tracking algorithm
to track the vehicle. Then for the license plate image after license plate location, 
this program use end-to-end algorithm for license plate character recognition. Finally,
to better perform the procedure of the license plate detection, I use QT system to show
all the processing of license plate detection.
